# Robotic System Dashboard

This project is a dashboard for monitoring real-time and historical data of a robotic system. It displays information such as battery level, operational status, and recent activity logs.

## Features

- Real-time display of battery level and operational status.
- Recent activity logs.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.
- Interactive elements including data refresh button and simulated real-time data update button.
- Backend server with SQLite database to store and retrieve robotic data.
- RESTful API endpoints for fetching data and updating data.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
  - React.js for building user interface components
  - Chart.js or D3.js (optional) for data visualization
  
- Backend:
  - Node.js with Express.js for creating RESTful APIs
  - SQLite for storing robotic data
